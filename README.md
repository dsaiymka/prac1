# Practice 1

This repository contains my Practice 1 work for learning Git and Python basics.

## Git Basics
I completed the GitHowTo tutorials (Introduction to Undoing Staged Changes) and practiced basic Git commands such as:
- creating a repository
- checking status
- staging and committing changes
- viewing commit history
- undoing changes

## Python Basics
I studied Python basics using the W3Schools Python Tutorial (from HOME to Python Strings).
For each topic, I created example .py files, including:
- syntax and comments
- variables
- data types
- numbers
- casting
- strings

All examples are stored in the PP2/prac1 folder and committed to this repository.
